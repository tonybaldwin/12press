<h1>What is the NA program?</h1>

<p>NA is a nonprofit fellowship or society of men and women for
whom drugs had become a major problem. We are recovering
addicts who meet regularly to help each other stay clean. This
is a program of complete abstinence from all drugs. <strong>There is
only one requirement for membership, the desire to stop using.</strong>
We suggest that you keep an open mind and give yourself a
break. Our program is a set of principles written so simply that
we can follow them in our daily lives. The most important thing
about them is that they work.</p>
<p>There are no strings attached to NA. We are not affiliated
with any other organizations. We have no initiation fees or
dues, no pledges to sign, no promises to make to anyone.
We are not connected with any political, religious, or law
enforcement groups, and are under no surveillance at any
time. Anyone may join us regardless of age, race, sexual
identity, creed, religion, or lack of religion.</p>
<p>We are not interested in what or how much you used or who
your connections were, what you have done in the past, how
much or how little you have, but only in what you want to do
about your problem and how <strong>we can help</strong>. The newcomer is
the most important person at any meeting, because we can
only keep what we have by giving it away. We have learned
from our group experience that those who keep coming to our
meetings regularly <strong>stay clean</strong>.</p>
