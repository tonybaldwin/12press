<h1>THE TWELVE TRADITIONS OF N.A.</h1>
<ol>
<li>Our common welfare should come first; personal recovery depends on N.A. unity.</li>
<li>For our group purpose there is but one ultimate authority–a loving God as He may express Himself in our group conscience. Our leaders are but trusted servants; they do not govern.</li>
<li>The only requirement for membership is a desire to stop using.</li>
<li>Each group should be autonomous except in matters affecting other groups or N.A. as a whole.</li>
<li>Each group has but one primary purpose–to carry the message to the addict who still suffers.</li>
<li>An N.A. Group ought never endorse, finance, or lend the N.A. name to any related facility or outside enterprise, lest problems of money, property or prestige divert us from our primary purpose.</li>
<li>Every N.A. Group ought to be fully self-supporting, declining outside contributions.</li>
<li>Narcotics Anonymous should remain forever nonprofessional, but our service centers may employ special workers.</li>
<li>N.A., as such, ought never be organized, but we may create service boards or committees directly responsible to those they serve.</li>
<li>Narcotics Anonymous has no opinion on outside issues; hence the N.A. name ought never be drawn into public controversy.</li>
<li>Our public relations policy is based on attraction rather than promotion; we need always maintain personal anonymity at the level of press, radio, and films.</li>
<li>Anonymity is the spiritual foundation of all our traditions, ever reminding us to place principles before personalities.</li>
</ol>
