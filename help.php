<h4>12Press HELP!</h4>

<p>At the moment, there is no documentation or help for the 12Press platform, yet, as we just started creating this platform recently.<br />
Soon...if we neglect to alter this page, the future location of such documentation and support is likely to be at:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/tonybaldwin/12press">12Press on GitHub</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/tonybaldwin/12press/wiki">12Press Wiki</a></li>
