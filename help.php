<h4>12Press HELP!</h4>

<p>At the moment, there is no documentation or help for the 12Press platform, yet, as we just started creating this platform recently.<br />
Soon...if we neglect to alter this page, the future location of such documentation and support is likely to be at:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/tonybaldwin/12press">12Press on github</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/tonybaldwin/12press/wiki">12Press Wiki</a></li>
</ul>
<h4>Help for Addicts:</h4>
<p>There is <strong>PLENTY OF HELP FOR ADDICTS</strong>, though!<br />Come to our meetings, call our hotline at 800-627-3543, reach out.<br />
We were once right where you are and desperate to stop using. We can help. Call us. We will love you before you can love yourself.</p>
<p><strong>Our message is HOPE, and the promise of FREEDOM.</br >
Any addict can get clean, lose the desire to use, and learn a NEW WAY OF LIFE.</strong></p>
