<h1>Just For Today</h1>

<p>Tell yourself:<br />
JUST FOR TODAY my thoughts will be on my recovery, <br />
living and enjoying life without the use of drugs.</p>

<p>JUST FOR TODAY I will have faith in someone in NA who<br />
believes in me and wants to help me in my recovery.</p>

<p>JUST FOR TODAY I will have a program. I will try to follow it <br />
to the best of my ability.</p>

<p>JUST FOR TODAY, through NA, I will try to get a better <br />
perspective on my life.</p>

<p>JUST FOR TODAY I will be unafraid. My thoughts will be on 
my new associations, people who are not using and 
who have found a new way of life. So long as I follow 
that way, I have nothing to fear.</p>
