Free/Open Source meeting and event schedule website with php/mysql for 12 step organizations, etc.

What's in this repo is a complete copy of the platform/software as created for my local NA area, 
however, I will be shortly removing such customizations and make this master branch generic for public consumption;

Still, YOU can clone it now, and completely alter the design and data for YOUR area, fellowship, organization, etc.

The backend admin stuff needs a lot of work, yet, but if you can manage a DB via CLI, now worries, the rest of the platform works fine.
