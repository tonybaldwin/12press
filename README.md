Free/Open Source meeting and event schedule website with php/mysql for 12 step organizations, etc.

**What's in this repo is a complete copy of the platform/software as created for my local NA area,**
however, I will be shortly removing all local customizations and make this master branch generic for public consumption;

*Still, YOU can clone it now, and completely alter the design and data for YOUR area, fellowship, organization, etc.* 

_The backend admin stuff needs a lot of work, yet, but if you can manage a DB via CLI, no worries, the rest of the platform works fine._
