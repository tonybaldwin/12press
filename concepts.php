<h1>12 Concepts of Service in Narcotics Anonymous</h1>
<ol>
<li>To fulfill our fellowship's primary purpose, the NA groups have joined together to create a structure which develops, coordinates, and maintains services on behalf of NA as a whole.</li>
<li>The final responsibility and authority for NA services rests with the NA groups.</li>
<li>The NA groups delegate to the service structure the authority necessary to fulfill the responsibilities assigned to it.</li>
<li>Effective leadership is highly valued in Narcotics Anonymous. Leadership qualities should be carefully considered when selecting trusted servants.</li>
<li>For each responsibility assigned to the service structure, a single point of decision and accountability should be clearly defined.</li>
<li>Group conscience is the spiritual means by which we invite a loving God to influence our decisions.</li>
<li>All members of a service body bear substantial responsibility for that body's decisions and should be allowed to fully participate in its decision-making processes.</li>
<li>Our service structure depends on the integrity and effectiveness of our communication.</li>
<li>All elements of our service structure have the responsibility to carefully consider all viewpoints in their decision-making processes.</li>
<li>Any member of a service body can petition that body for the redress of a personal grievance, without fear of reprisal.</li>
<li>NA funds are to be used to further our primary purpose, and must be managed responsibly.</li>
<li>In keeping with the spiritual nature of Narcotics Anonymous, our structure should always be one of service, never of government.</li>
